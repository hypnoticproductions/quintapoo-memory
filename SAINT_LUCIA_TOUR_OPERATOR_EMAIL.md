**Subject**: Saint Lucian-Built AI Voice Agent for Your Tour Guides 🇱🇨

Hi [Business Name] Team,

I'm Richard Fortune, founder of DOPA-TECH—a Saint Lucian tech company built by someone who actually worked in the hospitality industry. I know the challenges you face when guests speak Mandarin, French, German, or Spanish, and your tour guides are scrambling to communicate.

**What if your tour guides could speak 20+ languages instantly?**

We've built **Sally WUKR**, a multi-language voice agent designed specifically for Caribbean tourism. It's not a chatbot—it's a real-time voice assistant that can:

✅ **Translate tour commentary** in 20+ languages (Mandarin, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, and more)  
✅ **Answer guest questions** about Saint Lucia history, culture, attractions, safety  
✅ **Handle booking inquiries** 24/7 (even when your office is closed)  
✅ **Provide personalized recommendations** based on guest preferences  
✅ **Work offline** (no internet required for core features)

### Why This Matters for Saint Lucia Tourism

- **Chinese tourists** are the fastest-growing segment in Caribbean tourism—but language barriers kill bookings
- **European guests** (French, German, Italian) expect multilingual service
- **Cruise ship passengers** need instant answers in their native language
- **Your competitors** are still using Google Translate (and losing customers)

### Test It Yourself (Right Now)

Visit **www.dopa.buzz** and try Sally WUKR. Ask her about Saint Lucia attractions in any language. See how she responds. Then imagine this voice agent supporting your tour guides in the field.

### Built in Saint Lucia, For Saint Lucia

I'm not some Silicon Valley tech bro. I worked in hospitality here in Saint Lucia. I saw the language barriers. I built this solution specifically for us—for Caribbean tour operators who want to compete globally without losing our local authenticity.

### DOPA-TECH Services (Beyond Voice Agents)

2. **Harvester** - Legal tech for contract management and compliance (tourism licensing, vendor agreements)
3. **SafeTravel** - Risk management and safety monitoring for excursions
4. **WUKR Wire** - Caribbean market intelligence and content syndication

### Let's Talk

## Email Body (Version 2: Curiosity Hook)

**Subject**: Your Tour Guides Can Now Speak Mandarin, French, Spanish... Instantly

Hi [Business Name],

Quick question: How many bookings have you lost this year because a guest called and your team couldn't communicate in their language?

I'm Richard Fortune, a Saint Lucian who spent years in hospitality before building DOPA-TECH. I watched tour operators lose Chinese, French, and German tourists simply because of language barriers.

So I built **Sally WUKR**—a voice agent that speaks 20+ languages and understands Caribbean tourism.

**Test it yourself**: www.dopa.buzz

Ask Sally about Pigeon Island in Mandarin. Ask about Sulphur Springs in French. Ask about safety in German. She'll respond fluently—because she was trained on Saint Lucia-specific content.

This isn't a chatbot. It's a voice agent designed for tour guides who need real-time translation and guest support.

**5 free pilot programs available this month.** No credit card. Just test it for 30 days.

## Email Body (Version 4: Storytelling/Humble)

**Subject**: Speak 20+ Languages to Your Guests - Built Right Here in St. Lucia

Hi [Business Name] Team,

Five years ago, I was working at a resort in Saint Lucia when a Chinese family walked up to the tour desk. They wanted to book a catamaran excursion, but none of us spoke Mandarin. They left. We lost the booking.

That moment stuck with me.

Fast forward to today: I've built **Sally WUKR**, a multi-language voice agent specifically for Caribbean tourism. It's designed to solve the exact problem I faced—language barriers that kill bookings.

**What Sally WUKR Does:**
- Speaks 20+ languages (Mandarin, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, and more)
- Answers guest questions about Saint Lucia attractions, culture, safety
- Handles booking inquiries 24/7
- Works offline (no internet required for core features)

**Why I'm Reaching Out:**
I'm Saint Lucian. I worked in hospitality. I know the challenges you face. And I built this solution for us—not for Silicon Valley, not for Miami, but for Caribbean tour operators who want to compete globally.

**Test It Yourself:**
Visit www.dopa.buzz and try Sally WUKR. Ask her about Saint Lucia in any language. See how she responds. Then imagine this voice agent supporting your tour guides.

**Free Pilot Program:**
I'm offering 5 free pilot programs to Saint Lucia tour operators this month. No credit card. No commitment. Just test Sally WUKR with your team for 30 days.

If it increases your bookings, great. If it doesn't, no hard feelings.

P.S. I'm also building other tools for Caribbean tourism: Harvester (legal tech for contracts), SafeTravel (risk management for excursions), and WUKR Wire (market intelligence). But Sally WUKR is the one I think you'll love most.
