# DIAGRAM 4: CONTENT DIRECTION GUARDRAILS
## Complete System for Content Development Quality & Authenticity

**Version:** 2.0 | **Date:** January 2026  
**Lock-Step With:** Diagram 1 (Goals) + Diagram 2 (Network) + Diagram 3 (Frequency) + Diagram 5 (MANUS Tasks)

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

Every piece of content you create must pass through this guardrail system to ensure:
- ✅ **Authenticity:** ARM score ≥0.85 (Authenticity, Register, Memorability)
- ✅ **Cultural Safety:** No offensive mutations across corridors
- ✅ **Consistency:** Aligned with Morphic Systems narrative
- ✅ **Quality:** Meets phase-specific goals
- ✅ **Accessibility:** Appropriate for target audience per channel

---

## 1. ARM SCORING SYSTEM (Authenticity, Register, Memorability)
### Required for ALL content | Target: ≥0.85

| Component | Definition | How to Score | Target |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Authenticity (0-1.0)** | Is it grounded in real Caribbean-African context? Specific place, object, or vernacular term present? | If contains location (Castries, Kampala) + vernacular (Kwéyòl, Patois) = 1.0<br>One element only = 0.85<br>Generic/abstracted = <0.70 | ≥0.85 |
| **Register (0-1.0)** | Does the language match the genre/audience? Creole in dancehall? Standard English in op-ed? | Analyze: Is dominant language appropriate?<br>Is code-switching intentional?<br>Is tone consistent? | ≥0.85 |
| **Memorability (0-1.0)** | Can audience remember/repeat it? Specific nouns over abstractions? Percussive consonants? | Count: Concrete nouns vs abstract (concrete=higher)<br>Plosive density (b,d,p,k,t)<br>Syllable count ≤8 for hooks | ≥0.85 |

**ARM Calculation:**
```
ARM_Score = (Authenticity × 0.4) + (Register × 0.35) + (Memorability × 0.25)

GATE: If ARM < 0.85, REVISE before publishing
```

**Examples:**

✅ **PASS (ARM 0.91):**
- "Hide the ring in Marchand" (Kwéyòl "ring" concept, specific location, high memorability)
- Authenticity: 1.0 (location + vernacular), Register: 0.90 (soca context), Memorability: 0.85 (concrete objects)

❌ **FAIL (ARM 0.62):**
- "Living my best life in paradise" (generic social media, no location, abstract, low authenticity)
- Authenticity: 0.40 (no specific place), Register: 0.70 (doesn't match dancehall), Memorability: 0.70 (abstract)

---

## 2. AUTHENTICITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Before ANY content goes live, verify:**

### Linguistic Authenticity
```
□ Patois/Kwéyòl spelling verified (if used)
  - Jamaica: Jamaican_Vernacular_Node_Array reference
  - St. Lucia: Mannyè Ou Sa Li Èk Ékwi Kwéyòl standard (1999 SIL)
  
□ Orthography correct for target corridor
  - Example: "Gwan" NOT "Gwan" in dancehall
  - Example: "Kay" NOT "Kae" in Soca
  
□ Code-switching intentional, not sloppy
  - Is mixing English + Creole serving narrative?
  - Or just lack of clarity?
  
□ Native QA completed
  - 10% minimum of content reviewed by corridor-native speaker
  - Flag any awkward phrasing, cultural mismatches
```

### Cultural Specificity
```
□ Location-grounded
  - Specific neighborhood or landmark named?
  - Not generic ("Caribbean" = bad, "Marchand" = good)
  
□ Object-grounded
  - Tangible items mentioned?
  - Not abstract concepts
  
□ Scenario-grounded
  - Specific life moment referenced?
  - (carnival, fete, work morning, family visit)
  
□ Relationship-grounded
  - Kinship or social relationship clear?
  - (gyal, padna, boss, auntie, etc.)
```

### Avoidance List (Automatic Fail)
```
❌ NEVER include:
  ├─ Clichéd social media phrases ("living your best life", "slay queen")
  ├─ Offensive hand gestures/symbols without approval
  ├─ Slurs or terms with corridor-specific negative meanings
  ├─ Overly generic metaphors ("like water flowing")
  ├─ Unvetted spiritual/religious references
  └─ Content that implies outsider narrating community
```

## 6. CULTURAL SAFETY GATES (Mutation Analysis)

**Before publishing content in multiple corridors, verify:**

### Mutation Safety Check
```
STEP 1: Identify risky terms/phrases
├─ Slang that might vary by region
├─ Hand gestures (if visual content)
├─ Religious/cultural references
└─ Any term appearing ≥3 times

STEP 2: Test across corridors
├─ Jamaica: How would Jamaican interpret this?
├─ St. Lucia: How would St. Lucian interpret?
├─ Uganda: How would Ugandan interpret?
├─ Diaspora (London/NYC): How would diaspora interpret?
└─ Use: Native contacts, internet forums, example conversations

STEP 3: Classify
├─ SAFE: Consistent meaning across ≥3 corridors → Use freely
├─ CAUTION: Minor variations → Add context or avoid
└─ UNSAFE: Offensive in any corridor → DELETE or rephrase

STEP 4: Log in tracker
├─ Track tested terms (avoid re-testing same term)
├─ Update as new terms emerge
└─ Share list with team/partners
```

### High-Risk Examples (Already Tested)
```
✅ "Woy!" - SAFE (Jamaica, St. Lucia, recognized in Africa)
⚠️  "Batty" - CAUTION (Jamaica=neutral, UK slang context, US=mixed)
❌ [Specific gesture] - UNSAFE (Caribbean celebratory, West Africa insulting)
✅ "Lajan" - SAFE (Kwéyòl for money, specific to French Creole Caribbean)
⚠️  "Yaad" - SAFE (Jamaican but expanding, use in Caribbean-wide content)
```

---

## 7. QUALITY GATES & CHECKPOINTS

**Every piece of content passes through these gates before publishing:**

### GATE 1: ARM Self-Check (Done by you)
```
Before finalizing draft:
□ ARM score calculated (≥0.85 target)
□ Authenticity element present (location, object, or vernacular)
□ Register appropriate for genre
□ Memorability: Can you repeat the hook?

If failing: REVISE
If passing: Move to Gate 2
```

### GATE 2: Native Quality Assurance (If Kwéyòl/Patois)
```
If content includes vernacular:
□ Orthography verified with reference guide
□ Phrasing checked by corridor native
□ Cultural context validated (appropriate usage?)
□ No slurs or offensive terms

If failing: REVISE with native feedback
If passing: Move to Gate 3
```

### GATE 3: Mutation Safety Check (Multi-Corridor Content)
```
If content going to multiple corridors:
□ Risky terms identified
□ Cross-corridor testing done
□ All SAFE or properly CAUTIONed
□ No UNSAFE terms present

If failing: REVISE or narrow corridor scope
If passing: Move to Gate 4
```

### GATE 4: Consistency Check (Tone, Narrative, Brand)
```
Before publishing:
□ Tone matches phase guidelines
□ Narrative arc clear (Problem → Context → Solution → Action)
□ Brand voice consistent (Morphic Systems strategist, not generic)

□ All channel checklists completed?

PERFORMANCE CHECK
□ Views/clicks tracking to expectation?
□ Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) reasonable?
□ Any negative feedback or red flags?

QUALITY CHECK
□ Any typos, technical issues, broken links discovered?
□ Did tone/voice slip anywhere?

ADJUSTMENT FOR NEXT WEEK
□ What worked well? Do more of it.
□ What flopped? Debug or discontinue.
□ Do I need more content buffer (pre-write)?
□ Are guardrails being followed consistently?

DECISION
→ Continue as-is
→ Adjust approach
→ Skip or pause content type
→ Add new content type
```

---

## 10. RED FLAGS (Stop & Fix Immediately)

**If you see ANY of these, STOP and fix before publishing:**

```
❌ ARM score < 0.85 (Missing authenticity, weak register, or forgettable)
❌ No specific location mentioned (Generic = weak impact)
❌ Clichéd phrases ("living your best life", "slay", "vibes")
❌ Generic advice without grounding (Theory without ground truth)
❌ Typos, grammatical errors, or sloppy production
❌ Broken links or missing visuals
❌ Tone inconsistent with phase/brand
❌ No clear call-to-action
❌ Content published off-schedule (Diagram 3 frequency)
❌ Unvetted vernacular or potential mutation issues
❌ Performance metric not tracked (can't measure impact)

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Pull down / delay publication
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-check against guardrails
4. Log what went wrong (update process for next time)
5. Republish once fixed
```

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

**All content answers this question:**

> *Am I positioning myself as a continental strategist and operator, grounded in real ground truth from Caribbean and African contexts, building visible proof of the Morphic Systems thesis?*

If the answer is YES and it passes all guardrails → PUBLISH  
If the answer is NO or guardrails fail → REVISE or DELETE
