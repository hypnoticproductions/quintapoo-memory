# DIAGRAM 3: FREQUENCY FRAMEWORK - REVIEW & GUIDANCE

- Content flows consistently (no dark periods)
- Audience stays engaged (predictable touchpoints)
- Automation runs unattended (daily intelligence gathering)
- Goals progress measurably (weekly/monthly/quarterly checkpoints)
- Founder stays sustainable (realistic time allocation)

## CRITICAL REVIEW QUESTIONS

When reviewing Diagram 3, consider:

### WEEKLY RHYTHM
- [ ] Does Monday-Friday structure feel natural and realistic?
- [ ] Are task blocks (2-3 hours each) actually achievable in your schedule?
- [ ] Should any days be swapped (e.g., calls on Tuesday instead of Thursday)?
- [ ] Is Friday really your newsletter day, or would another day work better?
- [ ] Is Sunday rest truly non-negotiable in your situation?

### MONTHLY RHYTHM
- [ ] Does 4-week cycle align with how you think about progress?
- [ ] Are Week 2 (syndication push) and Week 3 (review) the right focus areas?
- [ ] Should any tasks be weekly instead of monthly?
- [ ] Is monthly reporting to partners necessary, or quarterly only?

### QUARTERLY MILESTONES
- [ ] Are the Q1-Q4 targets realistic for your situation?
- [ ] Should any Q1 goals move to Q2, or vice versa?
- [ ] Do milestones align with your actual resource availability?

### TIME ALLOCATION
- [ ] Does 20-25 hours/week feel sustainable for you?
- [ ] Which of your 5 activities is actually most important (30% of time)?
- [ ] Can you realistically REST on Sunday, or do you have weekend obligations?
- [ ] Should MANUS automation be expanded to free more of your time?

### SEASONAL EVENTS
- [ ] Which seasonal moment is MOST important to you?
- [ ] Should you attend 1+ festival/conference in person, or stick to virtual?
- [ ] Are there Caribbean-specific events missing (Reggae Sumfest, etc.)?

## OPERATIONAL SAFEGUARDS

Diagram 3 includes built-in protection against burnout:

✓ **Single-Track System:** No multi-tasking. Each day has clear focus (Mon=creation, Tue=outreach, etc.)

✓ **Automation Backbone:** MANUS handles intelligence gathering daily, freeing you for creative work

✓ **Monthly Reset:** Week 3 analytics review catches problems before they compound

✓ **Quarterly Gates:** Every 3 months, ask "Are we on track?" and adjust strategy

✓ **Seasonal Breathing Room:** Off-season months are lighter load, in-season (carnival, conferences) get extra effort

✓ **Sunday Rest:** Non-negotiable. System designed to thrive with 6 days of work, 1 day rest.

## WHAT'S NEXT (After Diagram 3 Validation)

Once you validate the frequency framework, the next diagram will show:

**Diagram 4: Content Direction Guardrails**
- "WHAT guardrails guide all content creation?"
- Authenticity standards (ARM scores ≥0.85)
- Tone + narrative consistency (Vor'thalis voice)
- Cultural safety checks (symbolic mutation analysis)
- Quality gates (before publishing)

**Diagram 5: MANUS Task Breakdown**
- "WHICH 20 specific tasks execute the entire system?"
- Each task mapped to: goals (1-4) + network nodes (2) + frequency (3) + guardrails (4)
- Task ownership (You vs. Shared vs. Automated)
- Success metrics and red flags for each

---

## SUMMARY

**Diagram 3 shows that frequency isn't chaos—it's RHYTHM.**

A sustainable 20-25 hour/week effort, backed by 5-7 hours of daily automation, executing 7-day cycles, 4-week patterns, and quarterly milestones. Seasonal moments amplify the baseline. And the system stops on Sundays so you can actually recharge.

This is how continental operators work: **consistency over intensity, rhythm over perfection.**

---

**Ready for your feedback:**
1. Is the weekly rhythm realistic?
2. Are the monthly/quarterly targets achievable?
3. Does 20-25 hours/week feel sustainable?
4. What should be adjusted?
5. Can you proceed to Diagram 4?
