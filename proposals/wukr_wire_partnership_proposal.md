## Why Now?

The US immigration freeze, Colombia's $1.7B Caribbean grid investment, and African startup funding surge (78% YoY) are creating a **Strategic Density event**. High-net-worth individuals are relocating to the Caribbean. Investors are pouring capital into African tech. Caribbean nations are weaponizing insularity through citizenship and digital trade policy.

This is a **once-in-a-decade opportunity**. The question isn't whether to engage with emerging markets—it's whether you'll be early or late.
